Diabetes Prediction Model
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical and demographic features. The project uses a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to develop a classification model for diabetes detection.

Project Overview
The project focuses on creating a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on various medical features like glucose levels, blood pressure, age, and BMI. The model uses a supervised learning approach, where the target variable is Outcome (1 for positive diabetes diagnosis and 0 for negative diagnosis).

Dataset
The dataset consists of 768 samples with 9 features. These include:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (kg/m^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years
Outcome: 1 for positive diabetes diagnosis, 0 for negative
Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We begin by exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any potential issues such as missing values, outliers, and imbalanced class distribution. Key techniques include:

Visualizing distributions of numerical features
Analyzing correlations between features
Detecting outliers
Data Preprocessing
The data undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure compatibility with machine learning models:

Normalization/Scaling: Numerical features are scaled to ensure they are in the same range for modeling.
Encoding: Categorical features are encoded into numeric format (if applicable).
Handling Missing Data: Imputation techniques are used to handle missing values (though the dataset has no missing values).
Outlier Detection: Outliers are detected and addressed using statistical methods such as IQR.
Model Training
Various machine learning models are trained on the processed data, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are used to optimize model performance.
